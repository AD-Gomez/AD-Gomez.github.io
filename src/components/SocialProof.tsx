    comment: "Shipping a car for the first time, I was completely clueless. Fortunately, I came across Cayad and Mr. Maiky, who made everything simple and clear. From planning to execution, he provided nearly perfect service, informing me of every detail and daily progress. If I ship a car again, I will definitely choose Cayad and Maiky once moreÔºÅ",

They keep in constant contact, showed up at the sellers on time and stayed in touch during the transport. The delivery driver was polite, on time and a real pro. I will use them again and strongly recommend them!!",
